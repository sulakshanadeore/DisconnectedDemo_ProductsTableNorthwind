You get disconnected when the data is filled in the DataTable.(Its a in-memory cache)

----When sending data to the database server
1)Connect to the db(SqlConnection)
2) Data Adapter(SqlDataAdapter) to write the statement on the table.("select * from tablename")
3) The Data Adapter gets the update from the Datatable, which it passes
to Command Builder(SqlCommandBuilder) which generates SQL commandS(Insert,Update,Delete)
4)This commandbuilder will send the commands to the Database server to update the records,
insert or delete.


----When receving data from the database server
**Only one statement is written with DataAdapter , which usually is . "select * from tablename"
1)Connect to the db(SqlConnection)
2) Data Adapter(SqlDataAdapter) to write the statement on the table.("select * from tablename")
3) Create a DataSet object, which can hold multiple tables,views etc from the database.
The Dataset represents DATABASE.
4) Inside the DataSet, we fill multiple tables(DataTable), views(DataViews).
Once the data is filled we are disconnected from the database server.
5) Each datatable has multiple rows(DataRows) and columns(DataColumns) as per the table queried, and 
these rows and columns can take the data.
6) DataViews are used to filter, order, etc the data.
DataViews fetch data from DataTables.

The advantage of using Disconnected is:
	1)  No need to upgrade the server hardware, even if multiple clients are querying it, 
	its truly disconnected.
	2) Whenever required reconnection is very simple and efficient.
